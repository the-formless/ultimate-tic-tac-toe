The Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is not a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.
.
You can realize that after just couple moves in to the game.
.
It can be described as a multi-dimentsional Tic-Tac-Toe.
.
The twist comes in after your first move. The next player has to place their move in the square you just moved but on the bigger board.
.
Suppose, player-1 chooses to place their character in the top right box of the smaller board and in the center of the bigger board. player-2 is constrained to move somewhere in the top right box of the bigger board.
.
Any of the players wins only when they have achieved 3 in a row on the bigger board.
.
It gets quite strategic and is not as easy to win as you might think.
